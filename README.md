# Ideas from tea-time
This repository contains work on a collection of problems that we think of through our everyday insights and experiences

We hope to discover interesting mathematical features and fun combinatorial scenarios

# Current usage of coding
We use code to simulate and visualize iterative processes

# Current list of problems
- Jumping Man Problem
- Smoothly rolling an n-gon
- Tilting tea and ellipses
